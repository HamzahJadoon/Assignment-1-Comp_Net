1. What is the name of website?
The website accessed is www.google.com

2. Find the packet that contains the Initial QUIC handshake. What information is exchanged here?

The packet labeled Frame 17082 is a QUIC Initial packet, identified by:
Long Header with Initial (0x0) type
Version Flag set
Packet Number: 0
Connection IDs: Source and Destination both set to 0x0000000000000000
Payload Length: 1256 bytes

Information exchanged includes:
QUIC version
Connection IDs
Embedded TLS ClientHello
Transport parameters (e.g., max stream data, idle timeout)

3. Identify the QUIC packet that contains the TLS ClientHello (QUIC embeds TLS handshake inside QUIC).

The Initial packet shown in your screenshot contains the TLS ClientHello inside its payload. 
You can expand the QUIC payload to view:
TLSv1.3 Handshake Protocol: Client Hello
Extensions like ALPN (for HTTP/3), supported versions, key share, etc.

4. Which QUIC version is used in your trace?
The QUIC version used is: Q046

5. Locate the packet where 0-RTT or 1-RTT keys are first used?
The packet shows:
ACK Frame acknowledging packet 0
Padding Frame with 1250 bytes
This suggests the handshake is progressing, and the next packets will likely use 1-RTT encryption. To confirm, look for packets labeled:
1-RTT Protected (used after full handshake)
0-RTT Protected (used for fast reconnects)

6. Find the first packet that carries application data (HTTP/3).
How does this differ from HTTP over TCP?

While the current packet contains ACK and Padding frames, application data (HTTP/3) will appear in packets with STREAM frames.
Differences from HTTP over TCP:
QUIC uses UDP, not TCP
No head-of-line blocking
Faster handshake (0-RTT possible)
Built-in encryption and multiplexing
HTTP/3 is carried directly over QUIC, not layered on top of TCP
