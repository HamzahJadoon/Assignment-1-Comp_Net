For the HTTPS based website access, answer the following:

1. What is the name of website?
The destination IP in your TLS packet is 172.217.194.113, which resolves to www.google.com.

2.Find the packet that contains the ClientHello message for the website you are accessing.

Protocol: TLSv1.2
Packet Type: Handshake
Handshake Type: Client Hello (1)
Length: 1751 bytes

3.List all the TLS extensions included in the ClientHello.

server_name
extended_master_secret
renegotiation_info
supported_groups
ec_point_formats
session_ticket
application_layer_protocol_negotiation (ALPN)
status_request
signature_algorithms
signed_certificate_timestamp
key_share
supported_versions
psk_key_exchange_modes
certificate_authorities
oid_filters
post_handshake_auth
signature_algorithms_cert
padding

4.Identify the ServerHello message. What cipher suite is chosen by the server?

Packet Type: Server Hello
TLS Version: TLS 1.2 (0x0303)
Cipher Suite Chosen: → TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0xc030)

5.Locate the Certificate message. Extract the server’s certificate information (issuer, subject, validity dates).



6.After the TLS handshake, identify the first encrypted application data packet. Why can’t you directly see the
HTTP headers in this packet?

Packet Type: TLSv1.2 Record Layer: Application Data

Reason You Can’t See HTTP Headers:
Because the data is encrypted after the TLS handshake. HTTPS wraps HTTP inside TLS, so headers and content are hidden unless decrypted with session keys.
